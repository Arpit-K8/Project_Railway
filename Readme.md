- `VITE_RAPID_API_KEY`
- `VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`, `VITE_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET`

**Backend (Backened/.env)**

### Run Locally
1) Backend
	- `cd Backened`
	- `npm install`
	- Add `.env` with keys above and ensure MongoDB reachable
	- `npm run dev`
2) Frontend
	- In new shell: `cd Frontened/Railway`
	- `npm install`
	- Copy `.env.sample` to `.env`, set real values
	- `npm run dev`

### Scripts
- Backend: `npm run dev` (nodemon), `npm start`
- Frontend: `npm run dev`, `npm run build`, `npm run preview`, `npm run lint`

### Notable Endpoints (backend)
- Auth: register, login, logout, refresh, current-user, change-password, forgot/reset, email verify/resend, Google OAuth callback.
- User: update-profile.
- Payments/Bookings: create-order, verify, failure, list bookings, booking detail, cancel booking.
- Notifications: list, mark read/read-all, delete one/all.

### Frontend Entry Points
- Router setup in [Frontened/Railway/src/App.jsx](Frontened/Railway/src/App.jsx)
- Dashboard in [Frontened/Railway/src/Components/Dashboard.jsx](Frontened/Railway/src/Components/Dashboard.jsx)
- Landing flow in [Frontened/Railway/src/Components/landingPage/Index.jsx](Frontened/Railway/src/Components/landingPage/Index.jsx)

### Notes
- JWT is accepted via cookie `accessToken` or `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on protected backend routes.
- Razorpay amounts are capped for test mode; booking references are generated per booking type.
- Mail setup defaults to Mailtrap for development; adjust SMTP for production.
- Project history: first repository (with original commits) was deleted due to an issue; this is a recreated repo. Estimated effort to rebuild and complete: ~19 days.
